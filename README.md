Project Description.

This project allows you to work with graphs in the Windows Forms environment. You can load graphs from files or enter them manually, check the equivalence of graphs, remove loops, and find central vertices. Graphical display of graphs and their processing is performed within the program interface.

#Libraries and technologies used

Windows Forms for creating a graphical interface.
System.Drawing for graph visualization.
Basic C# libraries for working with files, collections and basic data processing.

#Program features

Loading graphs from text files.
Entering graphs manually through text fields.
Visualize graphs before and after removing loops.
Checking the equivalence of two graphs (by the number of vertices, edges and central vertices).
Calculate the number of central vertices in each graph.

#How to use

Run the program
Load the project into the development environment (for example, Visual Studio).
Open the GraphWork.cs file and make sure that all dependencies are correctly connected.
Run the project by clicking the Run button.

#Program interface

Loading graphs:
Enter the name of the graph files in the appropriate text fields.
Click the Submit button to load the graphs.
Entering graphs manually:
Fill in the fields for the number of vertices and edges for each graph.
Enter a list of edges in the format: id1 id2 (each pair of vertices is separated by a space).
Click the Submit button.

#Visualization:

The graphs will be displayed in the corresponding fields before and after removing the loops.

Results:
After processing, the program will show the results of the graph equivalence and the number of central vertices in each of them through a pop-up window.
